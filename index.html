        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On Monday, I get to sleep in! I shower, get ready, make breakfast and then relax until it's time for class.
            <strong>Class(es)</strong> </p>
            <ol>
                <li>MI 401- 2:40-4:00</li>
            </ol>
            This class is online, so I immediately start homework after class. Here are some examples of what I do:
            <ul>
                <li>Read textbook chapter for tomorrow</li>
                <li>Watch CSE lecture videos</li>
                <li>Work on CSE homework assignment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Afterwards, I make food and relax for the rest of the night. </p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
            <p>My day starts pretty early, so I get ready and eat a quick breakfast. I tend to get very hungry on Tuesdays... I'm on campus for over <em>6 hours! I make sure to bring snacks.</em>
            <strong>Class(es)</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>SOC 214- 10:20-11:40</li>
                <li>MI 349- 12:40-2:30</li>
                <li>CSE 260- 3:00-4:20</li>
            </ol>
           <p>I take the bus back to my apartment after class, and I start homework after eating. I like to check my professor's provided CSE answers online at this website:
            <a href="https://auth.msu.edu/app/msu_atkalturamediaspace_1/exk8u02315pUc8NVh357/sso/saml">CSE 260 Homework Solutions</a> <br>
            After homework, I relax or meet up with friends.
